### Ask
Move this project's agent knowledge into its own repository with the `repo-setup` skill in Migrate mode, the same way levix-website did, and answer with the pull request that does it.

### Context
The owner decided on 2026-11-13 that every Levix repository keeps the agent's working knowledge in the repository, not in a tool, so any agent in any tool can work in it. levix-website applied it in Levix-Digital/levix-digital-website pull request #24, merged at commit 36281e6. The skill is `skills/repo-setup` in LeviGuilherme/agents-skills at commit 18a7cb1 (if your session cannot read that repository, ask the owner to add it to your project). It ships the templates, `scripts/scaffold.sh` and `scripts/check.sh`.

### Proposal
1. Install or read `repo-setup` and run its Migrate mode on your repository, on one branch and one pull request.
2. Target layout: `AGENTS.md` as the single source of instructions; `CLAUDE.md` containing only `@AGENTS.md`; project skills in `.agents/skills/`; `.claude/skills` as a versioned relative link to `../.agents/skills`; `.claude/settings.json` with attribution off.
3. Memory: exactly four files, `.agents/memory/preferences.md`, `workflow.md`, `environment.md`, `product.md`, created even when empty. Migrate your tool memory into them only for what has no other home (ADRs, docs/architecture, docs/product, backlog); discard session history and anything personal or account-specific.
4. Instructions that live only in your tool's project settings (cross-project messages, repository ownership, branch names, Git identity) move into `AGENTS.md`.
5. If you use Spec Kit: `specify integration switch agy` (it writes the skills to `.agents/skills/`), record `"integration": "agy"` in `.dev-cycle.json`, and restore the executable bit on `.specify/scripts/bash/*.sh` with `git update-index --chmod=+x`.
6. If your CI selects deploys or jobs by changed path, add `.agents/` next to `.claude/` in the paths that trigger nothing (levix-website had to).
7. Run `scripts/check.sh` before opening the pull request. Note: it reports the `.claude/skills` link with mode 100644 until the change is staged; run it after `git add`.

### Constraints
Decided by the owner: the four memory file names are fixed; the repository is the source of truth and tool-only features (hooks, subagents, JSON agents) are never a dependency. The attribution rule, word for word: "No AI attribution: branch names, commit messages and trailers, author and committer, tags, pull requests, issues, comments and release notes never name an AI, agent or assistant as author, co-author, reviewer or source. Agent configuration folders and files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .agents/, .claude/, .specify/) are allowed." On Windows, links need Developer Mode and `git config --global core.symlinks true`.

### Closes when
Your answer links a merged pull request in your repository whose `check.sh` reports "Layout is complete", or explains what in your repository the skill could not handle.

### Authority
How the migration is done inside your repository is yours to settle. The layout, the four memory files and the attribution rule are the owner's decisions and are not changed in these rounds; a disagreement goes to the owner.

### For the Dev Cycle Protocol in particular
Beyond your own repository, two suggestions for the protocol, to settle with the owner when you plan them:
8. DCP FEAT-029 could write this same layout (or call `repo-setup`) instead of keeping its own instruction-file template, and the `/dev-cycle` diagnosis could check the `.claude/skills` link and `core.symlinks` on Windows.
9. A bug seen while delivering features here: `check_milestone` and `update_plan_status` mark the backlog item done as soon as every milestone is checked, before the pull request merges and the deploy is verified; projects restore `docs/BACKLOG.md` by hand and close the item in a follow-up pull request.
